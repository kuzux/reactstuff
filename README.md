# elmstuff
Playing around with elm, nothing special really.

Current state: Some sort of todo list / isssue tracker, with no backend or any kind of data persistence.

## Running

Just run `elm-reactor`, it works with it. I currently have no idea how to use `elm-build`.

## Testing

Install elm-test with `npm install -g elm-test`. Assuming you have npm, if not, how on earth did you install elm itself? Then run `elm-test` which then runs and fails (tests are outdated, as is tradition).
