Playing around with react, nothing special really.

Current state: Some sort of todo list / isssue tracker, with no backend or any kind of data persistence.

## Running

Just run `npm run start`, it works with it. Use `npm run build` to get a production build, but that is very untested.

## Testing

Run `npm run flow` to check for type errors. Run `npm run test` to run the tests but they are ranging from very-outdated to simply nonexistent.
